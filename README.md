Vehicle Age Analysis:
Calculate the average age of stolen vehicles.
Examine if vehicle age trends differ across vehicle types.
Regional Analysis:
Highlight regions with the highest and lowest vehicle theft rates.
Investigate regional characteristics that may correlate with theft frequency.

### Methodology
